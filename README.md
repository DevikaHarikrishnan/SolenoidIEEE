# SolenoidIEEE

The arduino part of the IEEE Solenoid Engine project aims at timing the gap between the exhaust and intake movement of the piston of a four stroke engine. 4 LED pins were used to simulate the setup. The LEDs will be lit one at a time with a delay in between. Given below is the circuit diagram.
